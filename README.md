This is the replication package of the Information and Software Technology paper titled "The Impact of Human Aspects on the Interactions Between Software Developers and End-Users in Software Engineering: A Systematic Literature Review" authored by Hashini Gunatilake, John Grundy, Rashina Hoda, and Ingo Mueller.

This SLR employed the guidelines proposed by Kitchenham et al. We performed a comprehensive search in six digital databases, and an exhaustive backward and forward snowballing process. This paper reports the analysis of 46 primary studies.

This repository contains,
  - Search strings for each database
  - Data extraction criteria
  - Analysis of positive effects of human aspects 
  - Analysis of negative effects of human aspects

Researchers are invited to replicate the study. We appreciate receiving communication of the results through email (refer to the paper for contact details).

Best Regards,
